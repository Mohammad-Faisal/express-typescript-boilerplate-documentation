# Run manually

If you don't use Docker then you will get an exception specifying you don't have any database.
TO avoid that you can do 2 things.

1. First go inside the `.env.development` file and specify the following variables of a database server that you are using.

```
DB_HOST=database-layer
DB_NAME=dbname
DB_USER=dbuser
DB_PASSWORD=dbpassword
```

2. Otherwise go inside the `index.ts` file and on line number 29 comment of the following line

```js
dbClient = await connection.sync();
```
